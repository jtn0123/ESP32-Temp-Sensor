Rotate at the source first
--------------------------
  1. Change the password on the MQTT broker itself.
  2. Change the WiFi password if it may have been exposed.
     Rotating only the copies in this repo changes nothing: the credential is
     whatever the broker and the access point will still accept.

Then update every consumer
--------------------------
  3. This repo's .env
  4. Any sibling checkout's or worktree's .env (worktrees do not inherit it)
  5. config/device.yaml, if it carries any credential -- it should not; the
     generator reads secrets from .env, and device.yaml is for non-secret
     device settings
  6. Home Assistant, and any other MQTT client on the network
  7. Rebuild and reflash so the device carries the new value. The build
     regenerates firmware/arduino/src/generated_config.h from .env; that file
     is gitignored and must never be committed or attached to a release.

If a credential ever reached a commit
-------------------------------------
  8. Rotation is the fix. History rewriting is secondary and incomplete:
     GitHub keeps a permanent refs/pull/<n>/head for every pull request ever
     opened, and those refs survive a force-push and a branch deletion. They
     can only be removed by GitHub Support or by deleting the repository.
     Assume any value that was pushed publicly is permanently disclosed and
     rotate it; treat a rewrite as tidying, not remediation.

  9. Verify the value is gone from the working tree and from history:
       git grep -n '<value>' HEAD
       git log --all --oneline -S'<value>'
