# ESP32 Display Simulator Improvements

## Summary
Comprehensive improvements to the ESP32 eInk display simulator for more realistic emulation and better issue detection.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Text Measurement Accuracy
- **Improved font metrics**: Now uses actual character widths and includes font weight in calculations
- **Better height calculation**: Uses actualBoundingBoxAscent/Descent for precise vertical measurements
- **Granular severity levels**: More nuanced overflow detection (info, warning, error, critical)
- **Actionable suggestions**: Each overflow issue includes specific recommendations

### 2. Baseline Alignment Validation
- **Cross-region alignment checks**: Detects misalignment between related text regions
- **Alignment groups**: Validates INSIDE_TEMP vs OUT_TEMP, headers, footers, etc.
- **Tolerance settings**: 2px tolerance for minor variations
- **Visual consistency**: Ensures professional appearance across the display

### 3. Enhanced Collision Detection
- **Region importance weights**: Critical regions (temps, headers) get higher severity scores
- **Percentage-based severity**: Overlaps calculated as percentage of smaller region
- **Smart filtering**: Ignores intentional overlaps (label boxes, badges)
- **Detailed diagnostics**: Shows exact overlap dimensions and percentages

### 4. Realistic eInk Display Artifacts
- **Enhanced ghosting simulation**:
  - Previous image retention (more pronounced near edges)
  - Partial refresh boundary artifacts (horizontal bands)
  - Voltage-dependent contrast variations
- **Configurable intensity**: Toggle ghosting effects for testing
- **Realistic patterns**: Based on actual eInk display behavior

### 5. Comprehensive Data Validation
- **Range validation**: Temperature (-40 to 150¬∞F), humidity (0-100%), battery (0-100%)
- **Format validation**: Detects invalid numeric formats, NaN values
- **Missing data categorization**: Critical, important, and optional fields
- **Truncation detection**: Identifies when numbers are cut off ("99..." instead of "999.9")
- **Unit-only detection**: Flags when units appear without values ("mph", "%", "hPa")

### 6. Improved Debug Panel
- **Actionable validation results**:
  - Grouped by severity with color coding
  - Suggestions for each issue type
  - Quick-fix buttons for common problems
- **Visual hierarchy**: Critical issues highlighted prominently
- **Fix application**: "Apply Truncation" and "Reduce Font" buttons for text overflow

### 7. Expanded Test Scenarios
- **70+ test cases** organized in categories:
  - Text overflow edge cases
  - Battery states (0-100%, charging, unknown)
  - Weather conditions (12 different icons)
  - Missing data scenarios
  - Sensor limit values
  - Time formats
  - Special characters and Unicode
  - Display refresh patterns
  - Real-world data patterns
  - Error states
- **Quick testing**: Random scenario, cycle all scenarios
- **Data editor**: Live editing of all display fields

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Modular validation functions
- Better error handling
- Improved performance with coalesced redraws
- Exposed validation APIs for testing

### Testing
- All validation tests passing
- Edge case coverage expanded
- Visual regression testing support
- Automated validation reports

## Usage

### Running Validation
1. Open the simulator in a browser
2. Check "Enable real-time validation" in the UI Validation panel
3. Issues appear with severity badges and suggestions
4. Click "Apply Truncation" or other fix buttons as needed

### Testing Scenarios
1. Open Advanced Debug Tools panel
2. Select a test category (e.g., "Text Overflow Tests")
3. Choose a specific scenario
4. Click "Apply" to test with that data
5. Or use "Random" or "Cycle All" for automated testing

### Viewing Issues
- üî¥ Critical: Major problems that break functionality
- üü† Error: Significant issues that need fixing
- üü° Warning: Issues that should be addressed
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info: Minor issues or suggestions

## Future Enhancements

While not implemented in this update, these would be valuable additions:
- Pixel-perfect comparison with actual device screenshots
- Region heat map showing update frequency
- Memory usage estimation
- Power consumption preview
- Automated golden image regression testing
- Export validation reports as PDF/JSON
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
